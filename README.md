Search Engine Simulation - Demo
===========================
This project build a scalable search engine similar to Google or Bing.

This implementation includes applications of information retrieval concepts like text analysis (tf-idf) and link analysis (PageRank), and parallel data processing with MapReduce.

* Create a segmented inverted index of web pages using a pipeline of MapReduce programs.
* Build an Index server, a REST API app that returns search results in JSON format.
* Build a Search server, a user interface that returns search results just like Google or Bing.
